# Data-Science-Toolbox
This is a repository based on a summer school course I took in 2017 at the Barcelona School of Economics.

# Part 1

Part 1 covers a simple Python introiduction as well as typical examples of classical supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms applied to classic datasets such as the iris dataset and the titanic dataset. The main purpose of this repo was to see how scikit-learn works and take a closer look on few simple algorithmis such as regression, support vecotr machines and desicions trees as well as KNN. We also covered clustering and text classification asthe last part of the course.

# Part 2

Part 2 was more exciting since we proceeded with Keras and TensowFlow and trained neural networks. I will publish it after I cleaned up the code which is from 2017 and has to undergo some serious updates due to depreciated packages.
